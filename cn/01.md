基础协议流程说明
-------------------------------

`draft` `mandatory` `author:fiatjaf` `author:distbit` `author:scsibug` `author:kukks` `author:jb55`

该NIP定义了所有实现者应该遵守的基础协议。新的NIP可能会为此基础协议的结构和流程添加新的可选（或强制性）字段以及消息和功能。

## 事件与签名

每个用户都需要一个密钥对。签名、公钥和编码均基于 [曲线加密算法'secp256k1'的施诺尔签名标准](https://bips.xyz/340) 实现。

目前对象（传输的消息数据？）类型只有“event”一种，格式如下：

```json
{
  "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the the serialized event data>
  "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
  "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
  "kind": <integer>,
  "tags": [
    ["e", <32-bytes hex of the id of another event>, <recommended relay URL>],
    ["p", <32-bytes hex of the key>, <recommended relay URL>],
    ... // other kinds of tags may be included later
  ],
  "content": <arbitrary string>,
  "sig": <64-bytes signature of the sha256 hash of the serialized event data, which is the same as the "id" field>
}
```

“event.id” 通过对经过序列化的事件进行“sha256” 计算获得。序列化结构如下所示，是使用 UTF-8字符集的JSON 字符串（没有空格或换行符）：

```json
[
  0,
  <pubkey, as a (lowercase) hex string>,
  <created_at, as a number>,
  <kind, as a number>,
  <tags, as an array of arrays of non-null strings>,
  <content, as a string>
]
```

## 客户端与中继之间的通信

中继需要开放一个websocket 端点，以便客户端接入。

### 从客户端到中继：发送事件和创建订阅

客户端可以根据以下形式发送 3 种消息，这些消息必须符合 JSON 数组格式：

  * `["EVENT", <event JSON as defined above>]`, 用于发布事件消息。
  * `["REQ", <subscription_id>, <filters JSON>...]`, 用于请求新的事件消息和订阅新的更新频道。
  * `["CLOSE", <subscription_id>]`, 用于取消之前的订阅。

`<subscription_id>` is a random string that should be used to represent a subscription.

`<filters>` is a JSON object that determines what events will be sent in that subscription, it can have the following attributes:

```json
{
  "ids": <a list of event ids or prefixes>,
  "authors": <a list of pubkeys or prefixes, the pubkey of an event must be one of these>,
  "kinds": <a list of a kind numbers>,
  "#e": <a list of event ids that are referenced in an "e" tag>,
  "#p": <a list of pubkeys that are referenced in a "p" tag>,
  "since": <an integer unix timestamp, events must be newer than this to pass>,
  "until": <an integer unix timestamp, events must be older than this to pass>,
  "limit": <maximum number of events to be returned in the initial query>
}
```

Upon receiving a `REQ` message, the relay SHOULD query its internal database and return events that match the filter, then store that filter and send again all future events it receives to that same websocket until the websocket is closed. The `CLOSE` event is received with the same `<subscription_id>` or a new `REQ` is sent using the same `<subscription_id>`, in which case it should overwrite the previous subscription.

Filter attributes containing lists (such as `ids`, `kinds`, or `#e`) are JSON arrays with one or more values.  At least one of the array's values must match the relevant field in an event for the condition itself to be considered a match.  For scalar event attributes such as `kind`, the attribute from the event must be contained in the filter list.  For tag attributes such as `#e`, where an event may have multiple values, the event and filter condition values must have at least one item in common.

The `ids` and `authors` lists contain lowercase hexadecimal strings, which may either be an exact 64-character match, or a prefix of the event value.  A prefix match is when the filter string is an exact string prefix of the event value.  The use of prefixes allows for more compact filters where a large number of values are queried, and can provide some privacy for clients that may not want to disclose the exact authors or events they are searching for.

All conditions of a filter that are specified must match for an event for it to pass the filter, i.e., multiple conditions are interpreted as `&&` conditions.

A `REQ` message may contain multiple filters. In this case, events that match any of the filters are to be returned, i.e., multiple filters are to be interpreted as `||` conditions.

The `limit` property of a filter is only valid for the initial query and can be ignored afterward. When `limit: n` is present it is assumed that the events returned in the initial query will be the latest `n` events. It is safe to return less events than `limit` specifies, but it is expected that relays do not return (much) more events than requested so clients don't get unnecessarily overwhelmed by data.

### 从中继到客户端：发送事件与通知

中继可以按照如下形式发送两种消息，同样这些消息必须符合 JSON 数组格式：

  * `["EVENT", <subscription_id>, <event JSON as defined above>]`, 用于返回客户端请求的事件消息。
  * `["NOTICE", <message>]`, 用于发送可读的错误信息或其他数据给客户端。

This NIP defines no rules for how `NOTICE` messages should be sent or treated.

`EVENT` messages MUST be sent only with a subscription ID related to a subscription previously initiated by the client (using the `REQ` message above).

## 基本事件类型

  - `0`: `set_metadata`: the `content` is set to a stringified JSON object `{name: <username>, about: <string>, picture: <url, string>}` describing the user who created the event. A relay may delete past `set_metadata` events once it gets a new one for the same pubkey.
  - `1`: `text_note`: the `content` is set to the text content of a note (anything the user wants to say). Non-plaintext notes should instead use kind 1000-10000 as described in [NIP-16](16.md).
  - `2`: `recommend_server`: the `content` is set to the URL (e.g., `wss://somerelay.com`) of a relay the event creator wants to recommend to its followers.

中继可以选择以不同的方式处理不同的消息类型，并且可能会也可能不会使用默认的方式来处理它不知道的类型的类型。

## 其他注意事项：

- 客户端不应与每个中继建立多个 websocket 链接。一个频道支持无限数量的订阅，因此客户端需要保证链接只有一个。
- “tags”数组可以将标签标识符存储为每个子数组的第一个元素，以及之后的任意信息（始终为字符串）。本NIP协议定义了“p”（表示”公钥“，是事件消息中提到的某人的公钥）和“e”，表示“事件”，是本事件消息以某种方式括用，回复或引用的其他事件消息的id。
- “e”和“p”标记中的“<推荐中继 URL>”是客户端可以选用的中继（可以设置为”“/空？），以从标记的配置文件中提取标记的事件或其他事件。它可能会被忽略，但它的存在是为了增加审查阻力，并使中继地址在客户端之间的传播更加方便。
